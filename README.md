# Car Website
The Car Website displays a collection of cars with details like model, price, mileage, and features.
Users can search, filter, and sort cars based on brand, type (SUV, Sedan), or budget.
Each car has a dedicated page with images, specifications, and booking/contact options.
The frontend is built with React or HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and the backend uses Node.js or PHP.
It also includes a responsive design and optionally integrates Google Maps or a loan calculator.
